Crypto inside - See inside crypto algorithms
============================================
Crypto algorithms simply implemented with a lot of debug/trace logging internally.

Good for when you don't understand why/how/where your crypto is borked.

Possible imporvements:
----------------------
- Better CLI
- Test vectors
- Web GUI?

Currently implemented algorithms:
---------------------------------
- SHA256

Wishlist of future algorithms:
------------------------------
- AES (both Textbook and T-tables)
- SHA3
- MD5
- BLAKE2
- RC4
- HMAC
- CURVE25519
- RSA (with various padding schemes)
- Block cipher modes(CBC, CFB, ...)
